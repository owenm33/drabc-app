This method is not as guaranteed as surgical removal and after several years the skin may show signs of radiation damage.  If you have basal-cell carcinoma, your doctor can talk to you about which method is the best for you.  Metastasis is very rare for basal-cell carcinoma.  After the tumor excision, relapse is possible, though not frequent.  Furthermore, the risk of developing basal-cell carcinoma in other parts of the body is increased by 50% after having a first tumor.

Sometimes it\u2019s possible to obtain cells to determine if the type of cancer. This is done with repeated flushing of the bladder via a urinary catheter. To determine whether it\u2019s a case of micro- or macrohematuria, a urogram is conducted. With consideration to the findings and the general condition of the patient, the patient and doctor can discuss proper treatment. The following options for treatment are available: complete removal of the tumor via cystoscopy, local chemotherapy (direct to the bladder), BCG immunotherapy, partial or complete removal of the bladder and surrounding lymph nodes via operation (with different methods for allowing urine to drain), radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (in combination). The decision must be made on an individual basis for each patient. Discussing options with your doctor is highly recommended."

        "treatment": "The diagnosis of an absence seizure can be made by seeing the typical changes in EEG and the observation of the seizure. There are medicines that can help to prevent absence seizures. However it can be possible that multiple medication needs to be combined to have a freedom from seizures. And it\u2019s also possible that absence seizures will go away on their own. In children, 7 out of 10 kids with absence seizures will stop having them by age of 18. Possible treatment of patients with absence seizures only are sodium valproate or ethosuximide."

        "treatment": "An acute intoxication with alcohol may be life threatening and, in case of complete loss of consciousness, needs immediate intensive care in order to maintain vital functions such as breathing and circulation. Intoxicated persons should be put in a recovery position to protect them from aspiration of vomit. One of the most well-known treatments for alcohol use disorder is to join the mutual support group Alcoholics Anonymous. Besides, there are plenty of other possibilities like support with medication and behavioral therapies, as well as combinations of treatments."

Sometimes an in-patient therapy in a specialized clinic might be necessary. A complication of a mental trauma is the post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment for physical traumas also depends on the injury. Simple fractures or wounds can be stitched or rested in a plaster cast, while complicated or shifted fractures as well as contaminated, large wounds may require surgery. The more severe the injury or the more injuries a patient has, the more comprehensive is the treatment. Polytraumatized patients often need intensive care with ventilation or multiple surgeries."

        "treatment": "All autoimmune diseases are chronic and require lifelong therapy, to slow down the destruction of attacked structures and to maintain quality of life. In most cases therapy includes different medication that tries to influence the immune system to produce fewer antibodies against body-structures. As this therapy is not targeting a specific antibody, the immune-system will generally produce fewer antibodies, resulting in the patient being more susceptible to infections. Regular check-ups and therapy adjustments by a specialist for the respective conditions are important."

If possible, the source of infection should be treated. All other measures depend on the patient\u2019s symptoms. Infusions or organ replacement therapies (e.g. dialysis in case of kidney failure) are possible and often necessary at short notice. Despite intensive therapy the mortality rate of sepsis is 55% and even 60% for those with septic shock."

Once a Candida infection occurs treatment is normally external medication depending on the location of infected areas. A systemic infection only occurs in severely sick patients with a deficient immune system. Treatment should be carried out in hospital by a specialist."

An ultrasound, computer tomography or magnetic resonance tomography can confirm the diagnosis. Eventually, options for tumor removal should be considered. The definitive treatment is surgery and until the tumor is removed, a doctor should control the patient\u2019s blood pressure regularly. An endocrinologist should be consulted. He will design a treatment plan for the affected person in specific. For cases of malignant pheochromocytomas which cannot be cured by surgery or radiation therapy, a chemotherapy may be necessary."

In early stages, surgery followed by radiation can preserve the breast and chemotherapy before the operation can be used to reduce the size of the tumor. In the case of larger tumors, the entire breast together with the lymph nodes of the underarm need to be removed, after, could be followed by chemo, hormone, or radiation therapy. Removal of the lymph nodes under the arms can cause swelling in the relevant arm. Prognosis is very dependent on how far the tumor has spread."
